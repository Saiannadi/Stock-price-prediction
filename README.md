The Stock Price Prediction Dashboard is an interactive web application built using Streamlit, yfinance, StockNews, Prophet, and Plotly Graph Objects. With this dashboard, users can select a stock ticker from a predefined list, choose a date range, and explore various visualizations and predictions related to the selected stock's historical prices and news sentiment.

The dashboard fetches historical stock price data using the yfinance library from Yahoo Finance and displays it as a line plot. Users can analyze the stock's performance over time and identify trends. Additionally, the StockNews library is utilized to provide users with the top 10 news articles related to the selected stock ticker. The news sentiment is also displayed, allowing users to gauge the overall sentiment surrounding the stock.

The highlight of the dashboard is the stock price prediction feature. It utilizes the Prophet library, an open-source time series forecasting tool, to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The predicted prices are visualized alongside the actual historical prices, allowing users to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. The dashboard provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for both investors and enthusiasts to gain insights into their favorite stocks.

Overall, the Stock Price Prediction Dashboard offers a comprehensive and interactive platform for users to explore stock data, stay updated with the latest news, and make informed decisions about their investments. With its seamless integration of various Python libraries, the dashboard provides an insightful and visually appealing experience for anyone interested in understanding stock market trends and predictions.
